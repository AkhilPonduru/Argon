                <h1>What's a base?</h1>
                <div class="quiet">A <a href="https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/202576419-Introduction-to-Airtable-bases" class="pointer text-blue strong text-blue-dark1-hover focus-visible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> base</a>
                    is a collection of related tables, often reflecting a single project, process, or workflow that you collaborate on with your team. For example, you could make a base to organize your sales process, with tables for sales leads, companies, and deal opportunities. Each table contains records (similar to rows in a spreadsheet), which represent the individual objects, ideas, or people that you’re tracking. You’re free to create as many bases as you’d like on any of our plans.</div>

                <h1>What are the per-base record and attachment limits?</h1>
                <div class="quiet">While we don’t limit the number of bases you can create, we do limit records and attachment space per base. On the Free plan, we limit the total number of records you can have across all tables in a base. We also limit the total amount of attachment space you can use in a base. You can increase these limits by upgrading to one of our premium plans.</div>

When you upgrade and extend your history, you’ll see the history that was previously limited by your old plan’s limits.</div>

                , any team can share a subset of their data with any other team just by sharing a view within an Airtable base. With a simple link, any other team can sync that data directly into their own base and use it as if it were their own. Teams that want to share their data can carefully select which fields and records to allow for sync. They can also password protect or domain protect their data. This data can be refreshed manually with the click of a button — or, for users on Plus, Pro and Enterprise plans, it’ll automatically update every five minutes.</div>
